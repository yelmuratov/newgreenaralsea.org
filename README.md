## Mission Statement

Let's unite and save the Aral Sea region. We invite you to join us on this journey of regeneration and hope. Whether through advocacy, donations, or volunteer work, your support is crucial in turning the tide for the Aral Sea. Together, we can make a difference and restore the Aral Sea to its rightful place as a jewel of Central Asia.

## Quick Facts

- ‘Aral Sea’ translates to the Sea of Islands (of which there were once over a thousand!)
- At its greatest size, the Aral Sea was only slightly smaller than Ireland, fed by the Amudarya and Syrdarya rivers.
- The sea has lost 60,000 km², or 90% of its size, over half a century.
- 50% of Aral Sea flora and fauna has been lost, including 11 types of fish, 11 plant species, 26 species of birds, and 12 mammals.

## Why It Is Time to Act Now?

For centuries, the Aral Sea was the world’s fourth-largest inland lake. However, in just the past 60 to 80 years, the sea lost 90% of its size and was transformed into the Aralkum desert. This disaster has had catastrophic impacts on biodiversity. You can make a difference by making the environment healthier and more suitable. Studies show that each year, winds from the Aral Sea carry 100 million tonnes of toxic sand and salts to distant locations, harming livelihoods and well-being.

## How You Can Contribute

With just a few clicks, you can help us plant saxaul saplings on the Aral seabed. Every dollar you donate will plant one tree, helping our forest to grow. You can also support us by spreading the word through blogs, social media, events, and conversations.
